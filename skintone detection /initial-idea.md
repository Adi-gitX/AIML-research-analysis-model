Step 1 – Use STONE only for data extraction

Run the repo on a batch of face images.

It will detect faces, crop skin areas, and save results (skin_tone, tone_label, accuracy) in result.csv.

Collect those cropped patches (the real skin regions).
🪄 Goal: build your own dataset of face/skin patches + their tone labels.

🧠 Step 2 – Clean & label the dataset

Review or relabel tones (e.g., use the 10-level Monk Skin Tone scale).

Group patches into tone folders:

data/
├── tone_1/
├── tone_2/
...
└── tone_10/

⚙️ Step 3 – Train a CNN classifier

Use PyTorch or TensorFlow (e.g., ResNet18 / EfficientNet-B0).

Input = skin patch (128×128 pixels)

Output = tone class (1–10).

Train 10–20 epochs, evaluate accuracy, save model (skin_tone_cnn.pt).

🎨 Step 4 – Map tone → fashion palette

Create a JSON or DB mapping:

{
"tone_1": ["navy", "silver", "lavender"],
"tone_6": ["olive", "coral", "beige"]
}

When your CNN predicts tone 6, fetch its color palette for clothing recommendations.

🔁 Step 5 – Feedback & retraining

Add swipe feedback (👍/👎) to refine mappings or fine-tune your CNN.

Retrain periodically with corrected examples for personalization.

✅ Outcome:
You’ll have a custom, trainable skin-tone detection model (not just rule-based), tightly integrated into your fashion-recommendation engine.
